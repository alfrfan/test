DELETE BRANCH
try this:
1. Go to main
2. git switch chicken
3. git switch deleteMe
4. make sure we're in main/master branch_name
5. then run this. git branch -d deleteMe
6. notice the error
7. choose either want to merge and rerun the code
8. or run this query, git branch -D deleteMe 
9. git branch -D <branch_name> will force delete the branch

RENAME BRANCH
Try this:
1. Go the branch that we want to rename
2.











Use this code: 

git branch -d <branch_name>

if the branch is not yet merged with 'main' branch,
we will get error.

either merge the feature_branch with main branch with the code, OR :

git branch -D  <branch_name>

this will delete the branch irrespective with the branch's merge status.

Keep in mind, the main different of -d and -D is -D is a shortcut of '--force--delete'
