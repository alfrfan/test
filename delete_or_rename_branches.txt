DELETE BRANCH-- remote repo

git push origin --delete <deleting_branch>

RENAME BRANCH
Try this:
1. Go the branch that we want to rename
2. run this: git branch -m <branch_name>












Use this code: 

git branch -d <branch_name>

if the branch is not yet merged with 'main' branch,
we will get error.

either merge the feature_branch with main branch with the code, OR :

git branch -D  <branch_name>

this will delete the branch irrespective with the branch's merge status.

Keep in mind, the main different of -d and -D is -D is a shortcut of '--force--delete'
