if we clone from the repo, we only get main or master branch


try this :- git branch or git branch -r 

you will only see master or main branch

----------------------------------------------------

if want to get other branch in remote repo,
pls use : git switch <branch> name, the local branch will 
automaticallly link the branch with the repo. for example: 

git switch banana (local)

then this banana branch will automaticallly link to origin/banana

if branch not exist, we will get error
